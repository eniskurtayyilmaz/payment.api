First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I'm very excited to work with you. So, I tried to finish as soon as possible. I hope you will enjoy it.

When you check the project called "Payment.UnitTests", you will see test cases running on "Validators". I used FluentValidation and I like to use FluentValidation.

The other project is "Payment.IntegrationTests". I created a WebApplicationFactory from "Payment.Api" and I called the endpoint of the payment link. All of the validations and requests have been written.

The task is about validation for requests. So, that's why I just focused on validations of payment link requests but all of the cases runned. That could be added some business logic of payment link process, logging etc. I hope that it will be helpful to chosen at Arvato. I'm excited to work with you.

Best Regards,
